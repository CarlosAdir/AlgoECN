## Introduction

This repository contains the codes and reports made in the **Algorithmes - S5** subject of the **ECN(Ecole Centrale de Nantes)**, between *september* and *december* of 2019.


## TD - Demonstrative Activities

There were some demonstrative activities, that we could get the frist ideas about algorithme and data structure.

* TD1 - Functions, vectors and structs 
* TD2 - Functions
* TD3 - Functions
* TD4 - Listes and recursivity
* TD5 - Recursivity and trees
* TD6 - Pointers and references, listes and trees - Implementation with C++

## TP - Pratical Tests

The professors required us to do some algorithmes and solve some problems they gave us.
The total was 5 TPs that are showed below.
Each one of the requirements are in the *PDF* inside each folder.

As they required it for us and for the corection, 

#### Reports made in LaTeX

All the reports are inside each folder. That means, TP2's rapport is inside *TP2/* folder, and so on.

All of them were done in *french* because the professors required that.

* [ ] TP1
* [X] [TP2][TP2_latexread]
* [X] [TP3][TP3_latexread]
* [X] [TP4][TP4_latexread]
* [X] [TP5][TP5_latexread]

There is only the frist one lefting because they didn't required the report only for the frist one.
